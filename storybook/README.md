# Developing with Storybook using Lando

This example demonstrates a Lando configuration to power a sample Storybook/NextJS application.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. This example app is based on a Storybook Sandbox demonstrating a basic Storybook/NextJS web application. This example is running our app in a mostly-default Lando NodeJS service with a couple of small tweaks for the benefit of Storybook and the example app.
