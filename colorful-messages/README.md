At times it may be useful to display status or warning messages in your build
steps, tooling, or other events. A simple `echo` with a message may blend in
with the output of the commands that are running.

This example demonstrates how you can set variables for text colors and use
them to display colorful messages while Lando is performing your custom tasks
via build steps, tooling, or events.
