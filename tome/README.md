Tome allows you to leverage Drupal as a static site generator. Tome also allows
you to store your content statically. Any changes to config, content, or files
are automatically synced to your local filesystem. These exports can be used to
fully rebuild the site from scratch, which removes the need for a persistent SQL
database or filesystem.

This example leverages Lando, Drupal, and the Tome module to run a local "App"
that can be downloaded and run on demand.
